## Hybrid GLSL Architecture: Compute + Fragment Shaders

### 🤔 **The Question**

_"Is it possible to write a compute shader for the MLP and have a sister fragment shader for the rendering, all in GLSL?"_

### 🎯 **The Concept: Separating Concerns**

This hybrid approach addresses the fundamental architectural mismatch discovered in our investigation by using the right tool for each job:

**Stage 1: GLSL Compute Shader (Heavy ML Computation)**

```glsl
// Compute shader handles the complex NeRF MLP inference
#version 430
layout(local_size_x = 64, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1) in;

layout(std430, binding = 0) buffer RayBuffer {
    vec4 ray_origins[];
    vec4 ray_directions[];
};

layout(std430, binding = 1) buffer ResultBuffer {
    vec4 densities_colors[];  // Output: density + RGB
};

void main() {
    uint ray_id = gl_GlobalInvocationID.x;

    // Process one ray with all its samples
    for (int sample = 0; sample < samples_per_ray; sample++) {
        vec3 pos = ray_origins[ray_id].xyz + sample * ray_directions[ray_id].xyz;

        // Full NeRF MLP computation here (17.3 trillion operations total)
        float density = compute_nerf_density(pos);
        vec3 color = compute_nerf_color(pos, ray_directions[ray_id].xyz);

        densities_colors[ray_id * samples_per_ray + sample] = vec4(color, density);
    }
}
```

**Stage 2: GLSL Fragment Shader (Lightweight Volume Rendering)**

```glsl
// Fragment shader does simple per-pixel integration
#version 330 core
uniform sampler2D density_color_texture;  // Results from compute shader

void main() {
    ivec2 pixel = ivec2(gl_FragCoord.xy);

    // Simple volume rendering - just integrate pre-computed values
    vec3 accumulated_color = vec3(0.0);
    float accumulated_alpha = 0.0;

    for (int i = 0; i < samples_per_ray; i++) {
        vec4 density_color = texelFetch(density_color_texture,
                                       ivec2(pixel.x * samples_per_ray + i, pixel.y), 0);

        float alpha = 1.0 - exp(-density_color.a * step_size);
        float weight = alpha * (1.0 - accumulated_alpha);

        accumulated_color += weight * density_color.rgb;
        accumulated_alpha += weight;
    }

    fragColor = vec4(accumulated_color, accumulated_alpha);
}
```

### 📊 **Feasibility Analysis**

#### ✅ **Advantages**

1. **Architectural Correctness**:

   - **Compute shader**: Designed for heavy parallel computation (like PyTorch compute kernels)
   - **Fragment shader**: Simple per-pixel integration (its designed strength)
   - **Proper tool usage**: Each stage uses GPU architecture optimally

2. **Memory Efficiency**:

   - **Compute stage**: Process rays in large batches with shared memory
   - **Fragment stage**: Just read pre-computed values from textures
   - **No per-pixel MLP computation**: Eliminates the 36M operations/pixel problem

3. **Performance Potential**:
   - **Compute performance**: Should match PyTorch MPS performance
   - **Pipeline parallelism**: Both stages can potentially run simultaneously
   - **GPU optimization**: Uses GPU compute capabilities correctly

#### ⚠️ **Technical Challenges**

1. **Memory Bandwidth Requirements**:

   ```
   Intermediate data size (800×600 @ 64 samples):
   30.7M density+color values × 4 floats × 4 bytes = 491 MB

   Data flow: Compute shader → GPU memory → Texture → Fragment shader
   Transfer overhead: ~0.001 seconds (manageable)
   ```

2. **GPU Texture Size Limitations**:

   ```
   Option A - Wide 2D Texture:
   Width: 800×64 = 51,200 pixels
   Problem: Exceeds typical GPU texture width limits (~16K)

   Option B - Tiled 2D Texture:
   Tile 64 samples into 8×8 regions
   Final size: (800×8) × (600×8) = 6,400×4,800
   Problem: Complex indexing required in fragment shader

   Option C - 3D Texture:
   Dimensions: 800×600×64
   Size: 491 MB
   Problem: May exceed 3D texture memory limits
   ```

3. **Pipeline Synchronization**:
   - **Compute must complete** before fragment shader can start
   - **GPU pipeline stalls** during stage transitions
   - **Memory barriers** required between compute and fragment stages
   - **Synchronization overhead**: Additional complexity vs single-stage approaches

#### 📈 **Performance Estimation**

**Compute Shader Stage:**

```
Total operations: 17.3 trillion (identical to PyTorch approach)
Execution model: Similar to PyTorch Metal compute kernels
Architecture: Optimized for batch parallel processing
Expected performance: ~20-30 seconds (similar to PyTorch MPS)
Memory usage: Efficient batch processing with shared weights
```

**Fragment Shader Stage:**

```
Operations per pixel: 64 samples × integration (~200 operations)
Total operations: 800×600×200 = 96 million operations
Expected performance: <0.1 seconds (within fragment shader capabilities)
Memory access: Simple texture reads (GPU optimized)
```

**Total Pipeline:**

```
Compute stage: ~25 seconds
Memory transfer: ~0.001 seconds
Fragment stage: ~0.1 seconds
Total: ~25.1 seconds (competitive with PyTorch)
```

### 🎯 **Technical Verdict: POTENTIALLY FEASIBLE**

## 🎮 Real-Time Micro-NeRF for Interactive Rendering

### 📅 **Discussion Date**: June 16, 2025 - Post-Benchmark Training

### 🎯 **The Concept: Backwards-Planned NeRF Architecture**

Following the abandonment of the full-scale GLSL fragment shader approach due to M3 computational limits, an intriguing alternative emerged: **design a NeRF architecture specifically tailored to fragment shader constraints** rather than trying to force the full NeRF architecture into inappropriate hardware limits.

### 🧮 **Computational Budget Analysis**

**M3 Fragment Shader Constraints (Established):**

- Safe operation limit: ~10 million operations per pixel
- Memory per pixel: <1KB local variables
- Target resolution: 512×512 (262,144 pixels)
- Available budget: ~38 operations per pixel per sample
- At 16 samples per ray: ~600 operations total per pixel

### 🏗️ **Micro-MLP Architecture Design**

**Ultra-Lightweight Network:**

```python
class MicroNeRF(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Backwards-planned for fragment shader constraints
        self.pos_encoder = PositionalEncoder(levels=2)  # 2 levels vs 10
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(15, 16)  # 15 encoded → 16 neurons
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(16, 8)   # 16 → 8
        self.density = nn.Linear(8, 1)   # 8 → 1 density
        self.color = nn.Linear(8, 3)     # 8 → 3 RGB

    # Total: ~400 operations per query (within budget!)
```

**Architecture Tradeoffs:**

- **Layers**: 2-3 maximum (vs 8 in full NeRF)
- **Neurons**: 16-32 per layer (vs 256 in full NeRF)
- **Encoding**: 2-3 levels (vs 10 in full NeRF)
- **Skip connections**: None (too expensive)
- **Activations**: Simplified or eliminated
